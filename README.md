# SCENARIO

What do I watch tonight ?! Good question, right ?!

Here's a website based on TMDB API to help you find something to watch for tonight.

You can search for a movie, TV show, actor, director, etc... Also, there's a "Top" page showing you which movies and TV shows are the best rated. "Discover" help you to find new ideas. You can sort everying by any genre, release date, rating or popularity. Every choice allows you to be redirect on Youtube for a trailer. You can also see directly on the page, on which streaming plateform it's available for your country. EN-UK, EN-US and FR are supported for now.

You're now able to create an account :

    - Personalize it with a banner and a username
    - Mark any movie or TV show as watched
    - Create a watchlist
    - Add any movie or show to a watchlist
    - Get stats about time spend watching movies, number of episodes watched, etc...
