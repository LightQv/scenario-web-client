You can search for a movie, TV show, actor, director, etc...
Also, there's a "Top" page showing you which movies and TV shows are the best rated.
"Discover" help you to find new ideas. You can sort everying by any genre, release date, rating or popularity.
Every choice allows you to be redirect on Youtube for a trailer. You can also see directly on the page, on which streaming plateform it's available for your country.
